# Search-Chrome-Tabs-Like-Sublime-Cmd-P

The original extension can be installed here:

I changed some things that weren't working for me with the original extension. But i give 100% credit to the original developer for this chrome-extension.

I could have changed the `manifest.json` file in order to have the shortcut `Cmd+P` run as default, but i didn't...so remember to go to `chrome://extensions/` and set the shortcut you want to use.


- Opened Tabs show up in grey
- Bookmarked Tabs show up in yellow
- Tabs in history show up in blue


Pressing `Enter` right after typing text opens the first result tab.

To navigate use the `up` and `down` `arrow-keys`.

First time pressing the `down-arrow-key` it starts at the second result tab.
